# Onward Client

An application specifically designed for CEO like minded individuals that allows the user to create an account and set up a complex company based on Leaders, Employees, and Projects. The user is allowed to create and update all of the attributes and is protected so that other users cannot modify or delete their information. All three attributes are related to one another in this project planning application.

# Development & Problem Solving Process

- For the layout, a wire frame and entity relationship diagram  was created for the overall basis of how the front would look, as well as how the tables in the back end would relate to one another. Links below.

- User stories were then created to get a sense of how the user experience would
be produced and implemented.

- During creation, the API / backend was created first relying heavily on curl
scripts for testing. Then migrations were run to produce and populate to tables
on the database. Heroku hold the current existing online api that the client
communicates with. Then once the api was up and runnning, the client side was
then developed, creating multiple forms to manipulate the database.

# Version Documentation

Both client and api sides of the application contain multiple versions.
Each version was merged to the master branch once a feature was tested and
complete. All represented by v1-v(x).

# Unsolved Problems

- Display database information in a more oraginized fashion.
- Make inputting ID's between table relationships more user friendly.
